Q 5: Write an application for placement office such that the Student objects can be stored in an array. Student contains attributes name, registration number, cgpa, course (B. Tech/MBA/M Tech) and placement status(true/false). Use appropriate constructor for the Student class. Now implement a method which takes the minimum cgpa and eligible course as an argument and returns the number of eligible students for that placement drive. Method must display the details of all the Students who are eligible (i.e. having cgpa greater than the argument one, belong to the same course as required and are not placed.)
In main, Read the cgpa and course from the command line argument and display the eligible students.
